Country API Documentation
Application Description
The Country API provides an extensive database of countries, allowing users to retrieve detailed information about countries around the globe. Our intuitive API supports various filtering options, including filtering by name, population range, sorting preferences, and limiting the number of results returned. By offering these features, we aim to make it simpler for developers to fetch data tailored to their specific needs, ensuring efficient queries and useful results. Whether you're building a geography-based game, an educational tool, or a sophisticated data analytics platform, our Country API is the ideal solution to source accurate and up-to-date country information.

Endpoint: /countries
This endpoint allows users to retrieve a list of countries based on several optional parameters.

Parameters:
name (optional): A string value. Filters the countries by names that contain the provided value.
population (optional): A number (in millions). Filters the countries where the population is lower than the provided value.
sortBy (optional): Accepts either 'ascend' or 'descend'. Sorts the countries based on the provided order.
limit (optional): An integer. Filters the amount of countries returned by the endpoint.
Examples:
Get all countries:

bash
Copy code
GET /countries
Get countries with names containing 'land':

bash
Copy code
GET /countries?name=land
Get countries with a population less than 10 million:

bash
Copy code
GET /countries?population=10
Get countries sorted in ascending order:

bash
Copy code
GET /countries?sortBy=ascend
Get countries sorted in descending order:

bash
Copy code
GET /countries?sortBy=descend
Get the top 5 countries in ascending order:

bash
Copy code
GET /countries?sortBy=ascend&limit=5
Get countries with names containing 'land' and a population less than 50 million:

bash
Copy code
GET /countries?name=land&population=50
Get the top 3 countries with names containing 'land' sorted in descending order:

bash
Copy code
GET /countries?name=land&sortBy=descend&limit=3
Get the top 10 countries with a population less than 100 million in descending order:

bash
Copy code
GET /countries?population=100&sortBy=descend&limit=10
Get countries with names containing 'ca', sorted in ascending order, and a population less than 80 million:

bash
Copy code
GET /countries?name=ca&sortBy=ascend&population=80
Remember, while all parameters are optional, combining them can provide more tailored results. Adjust the parameters according to your requirements to get the most out of the Country API.
